				<p>
					I’m a Digital Marketer, CRM and Email Marketing Specialist, reader and
					mom of a 3-year-old cat named Scooter and 15+ house plants.
				</p>
				<p>
					Through my experience, I have had the opportunity to create digital
					content/ strategies for my clients and enhance customer experience
					through customer-centric journey maps as well as the buyer persona.
				</p>
				<p>
					Data speak louder than words. Taking a deep dive on analytics is
					essential in understanding what your audience needs and wants. I truly
					believe in data-driven marketing for better business decision making
					and develop a stronger relationship with customers.
				</p>
				<p>
					I came to Canada from Vietnam as an international student in 2018. I
					completed 2 post-graduate certificates including Strategic
					Relationship Marketing and Marketing Management and Financial Services
					at George Brown College.
				</p>
				<p>
					I graduated from university with a major in Linguistics. Soon
					before graduation, I found myself having a passion for digital
					marketing then started my career as a content creation at a tech start-up company. I do love creating content so much that I launched my own Facebook fan page with around 10,000k followers to satisfy my hobby.
				</p>
				<p>
					After 2 years of hard-work and gained intensive experience in marketing, I realized that proper training is necessary. The decision to leave a growing career path is a huge one, especially moving to a foreign country. Yes, it is indeed
					difficult and challenging. But the reward is huge as well, that helps
					me build my resilience, strength and flexibility.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of my main passions is about learning. I’m a life-long learner.
				</p>
				<p>
					I love reading books, YouTube-learn, LinkedIn Learning, attending
					events and talking with like-minded people about digital marketing
					trends, technology or marketing in general. Hit me up if you know a
					great upcoming meetup or event in Toronto.
